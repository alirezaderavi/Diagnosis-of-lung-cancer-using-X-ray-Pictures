# Diagnosis of Lung Cancer using X-ray Pictures

## Description
Lung cancer is a growing concern due to factors like air pollution and urban living. Medical
imaging has become increasingly useful for diagnosing lung cancer, but not all procedures are
accessible or cost-effective. X-ray scans may be the best option for cost-effective imaging. This
study employs X-ray images that were frequently used in recent papers. Machine learning
algorithms are used to extract information from these photographs in order to identify between a
healthy person and a patient. Six machine learning models were selected out of the 11 available
for this paper, and every combination has been tried. A vote classifier was used to combine these
combinations. Model combination strategies were used to improve the modelâ€™s Accuracy,
Sensitivity, precision, Specificity, and F1 score. The importance weights of each model can be
determined in a variety of ways, however, in this investigation, q-learning and the multi-armed
bandit were used as two well-known reinforcement learning strategies. The decision tree technique
gave us the highest accuracy rate, which was 70.15%, thanks to the use of machine learning
models. Notably, our novel strategy resulted in a considerable improvement, raising the accuracy
rate to a remarkable 72.78%. This achievement surpasses that of other models with 7.27%. It is
important to note that the previous dataset had shadows present, whereas we used photos with no
shadows. This improvement had a favorable effect on a number of metrics, including Sensitivity,
Precision, Specificity, and F1 score, which will be covered in more depth later.
